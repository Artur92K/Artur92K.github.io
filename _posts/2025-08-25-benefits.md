Some time ago, I had the opportunity to participate in an article where developers shared their views on how employee benefits impact the decision to join a company. The discussion looked at benefits from a technical and career development standpoint, exploring whether they truly matter alongside other key factors.

How do senior developers approach benefits today? To what extent do benefits contribute to the choice of an employer? I invite you to explore these questions and more by reading the full article.

Please note that the article is written in Polish, but in today's world, there are many excellent AI-based translation tools available that make accessing content in other languages easier than ever. I encourage you to give it a try!

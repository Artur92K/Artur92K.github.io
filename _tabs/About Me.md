#### Welcome! <br><br>
My name is Artur, a seasoned software engineer and technical team leader with over 10 years of experience in the IT industry.  
I specialize in Java and Kotlin programming, microservices architecture, and modern software development practices.  
Currently, I work at Warner Bros. Discovery (HBO Max), focusing on scalable systems using technologies such as Spring Boot, Kafka, gRPC, Kubernetes, and AWS.

I hold a Master of Science degree in Electronics and Telecommunications from the Military University of Technology in Warsaw.  
Over the years, I have gained deep expertise in building and leading software teams, designing system architectures with a focus on scalability, performance, and security in real-world projects.

Throughout my career, I have participated in several notable technology conferences, including 4developers.net and various AWS Summit events,  
where I shared knowledge and stayed engaged with the latest trends in software engineering.

I am also available for mentoring, with over 3 years of experience helping others grow their professional skills in software development and leadership.

### More About Me

Outside of work, I am passionate about martial arts, holding a brown belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.  
I am an enthusiast of biohacking and maximizing human potential.  
Additionally, I actively enhance my financial knowledge through smart asset management and continuous learning.  
These interests help me maintain balance and continuously improve both personally and professionally.
